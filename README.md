# Stash-VR
Watch your [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) library in VR for that full immersion effect.

Stash-VR bridges your Stash instance and VR video player allowing you to browse, play and manage your scenes using the video players native VR UI.

It's lightweight, optionally configurable and has support for two-way sync.

**[Install](#Installation) Stash-VR, point it to your Stash instance and point your VR video player to Stash-VR.**

(Traditional flat/2d videos as well as VR videos are supported.)

## Supported video players
* HereSphere (two-way sync)
* DeoVR

## Features
* Browse, play and manage videos from your Stash library using the native VR UI of supported video players.
* Customizations from your Stash front page and saved filters.
* Heatmaps for interactive scenes generated by Stash.
* Transcoding endpoints to your videos served by Stash
* HereSphere
  * Two-way sync of tags, rating, markers
  * Increment o-count/play count
  * Generate categorized tags, studios, performers
  * Delete scenes
  * Funscript
  * Subtitles
* DeoVR
  * Markers(?)

## Installation
Container images available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ofl0w/stash-vr/tags).

For details or docker compose see [docker_compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

After installation open your endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:9666`) in a regular browser to verify your setup.

### Docker
```
docker run --name=stash-vr -e STASH_GRAPHQL_URL=http://stash-host:9999/graphql -e STASH_API_KEY=XXX -p 9666:9666 ofl0w/stash-vr:latest
```

Stash-VR listens on port `9666` by default. To change local port, use docker port binding, e.g. `-p 9000:9666`, or set env. `LISTEN_ADDRESS=:9000` to listen on port `9000` instead.

### Binaries
Download and extract a binary for your platform. Run `stash-vr -h` to display help.

Example: Connect to Stash running on stash-host:9999 with api key XXX and set Stash-VR to listen on port 9000:

`stash-vr --STASH_GRAPHQL_URL=http://stash-host:9999/graphql --STASH_API_KEY=XXX --LISTEN_ADDRESS=:9000`

### Configuration
* `STASH_GRAPHQL_URL`
  * **Required**
  * Url to your Stash graphql - something like `http://<stash.host>:<9999>/graphql`.
* `STASH_API_KEY`
  * Api key to your Stash if it's using authentication, otherwise not required.

<details>
<summary>More (click to expand)</summary>

* `FAVORITE_TAG`
  * Default: `FAVORITE`
  * Name of tag in Stash to hold scenes marked as [favorites](#favorites) (will be created if not present).
* `HEATMAP_HEIGHT_PX`
  * Default: 0 (use height of heatmap)
  * Manually set height of all heatmaps. If not set, height of the heatmap retrieved from Stash will be used, currently 15 by default.
* `DISABLE_PLAY_COUNT`
  * Default: `false`
  * Disable incrementing Stash play count for scenes. Will otherwise send request to Stash to increment play count when video is played in HereSphere.
* `FORCE_HTTPS`
  * Default: `false`
  * Force Stash-VR to use HTTPS. Useful as a last resort attempt if you're having issues with Stash-VR behind a reverse proxy.
* `EXCLUDE_SORT_NAME`
  * Default: `hidden`
  * Tags with this sort name will not be applied to videos or used for categorization.

## Usage
Browse to `http://<host>:9666` using a supported video player. You'll be presented with your library within their respective native UI.
### HereSphere
##### Two-way sync
To enable two-way sync with Stash the relevant toggles (`Overwrite tags` etc.) in the cogwheel at the bottom right of preview view in HereSphere needs to be on.
#### Manage metadata
Scene metadata is handled using `Video Tags` in HereSphere. Both for presentation and making changes.

* Scene tags
  * `#:<Name>`
  * To tag a scene, create a tag in HereSphere following above format.
    * `#:Music` will apply the tag `Music`, creating it if necessary.
  * To untag a scene, delete the tag in HereSphere.
  * Name may not start with `#`
    * ~~`#:#Music`~~
* Studio
  * `Studio:<Name>`
* Performers
  * `@:<Name>`
* Groups
  * `%:<Name>`
* Play count
  * `Played:<Count>`
  * Automatically incremented
    * To disable, set `DISABLE_PLAY_COUNT=true`
    * Uses `Minimum Play Percent` from Stash if set.
  * To decrement (delete last timestamp), delete the `Played` tag
* O-Count
  * `O-Count:<Count>`
  * To increment, add a tag `/o`
  * To decrement (delete last timestamp), delete the `O-Count` tag
* Organized
  * `Organized:<bool>`
  * To set organized, add a tag `/org`
  * To unset organized, delete the `Organized` tag
* Markers
  * Everything else is treated as a marker
  * `<Primary Tag Name>` (empty title)
    * `Music` will create marker with tag `Music` spanning HereSphere tag length
  * `<Primary Tag Name>:<Title>`
    * `Music:Solo` will create marker with tag `Music` and title `Solo` spanning HereSphere tag length
  * Set the start and end time using HereSphere controls.
  * Changes in HereSphere will sync to Stash

Changes reflect in HereSphere when videos are re-opened.

#### Favorites
When the favorite-feature of HereSphere is first used Stash-VR will create a tag in Stash named according to `FAVORITE_TAG` (set in docker env., defaults to `FAVORITE`) and apply that tag to your scene.

#### Rating
Ratings set in HereSphere will be converted to its equivalent in Stash (4.5 stars => 90). Setting half-star will unset rating.

## Known issues/Missing features

### Unsupported filter types
* Premade Filters (i.e., Recently Released Scenes etc.) from Stash front page are not supported.
  * Tip: If you really want such filters to show they can easily be recreated and saved using regular filters in Stash.

### HereSphere sync of markers
When using `Video Tags` in HereSphere to edit markers Stash-VR will no longer delete and (re)create them on updates.
We use the rating field of a marker in HereSphere to transport the id for correlating the markers in HereSphere to a marker in Stash, hacky.

### Scene count limits (More than 10.000 links generated)
DeoVR/HereSphere both seem to have limits and struggle/crash when too many videos are provided than they can handle.
  * For HereSphere the limit seems to be around 10k unique scenes.
    * Fixed in HereSphere v0.7.3?
  * Tip: If you have a VERY LARGE library and your player is struggling to load them all, try explicitly setting env. var. `FILTERS` with a list of filter ids such that the total amount of videos are lowered to a "reasonable" amount.

### Missing thumbnail images in DeoVR
DeoVR won't show images served through HTTP - seems they only allow HTTPS. See https://github.com/xbapps/xbvr/issues/1705

### Missing thumbnail images in HereSphere
HereSphere doesn't support WEBP images, which is sometimes fetched when scraping from Stash. A workaround is to manually regenerate a cover using Stash for those scenes.

## Troubleshooting
- If your Stash requires an api key, make sure you provide it to Stash-VR
- Make sure Stash-VR has network access to Stash
- Make sure your VR-headset has network access to both Stash and Stash-VR
  - Try explicitly setting `LISTEN_ADDRESS` to the external (accessible by headset) ip:port of Stash-VR
- If you can't seek or get errors about unsupported encoding/format, set the `Encoding` drop-down (above the seekbar) in HereSphere to `direct`. There's also an equivalent setting in DeoVR.
